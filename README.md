# Astor Butler

FSM-first hospitality governance runtime for restaurants, hotels and event venues.

Astor Butler is not a Telegram bot. Telegram is the first transport adapter. The
product core is a controlled runtime where a finite-state machine, domain
services and auditable storage decide what can happen next.

The initial venue is AERIS gastro bar. The target buyer is a restaurateur or
hospitality operator. The end user is the guest. The operating users are hostess,
staff, manager and administrator roles.

## Executive Summary

Restaurants do not lose guests only because of food or price. They lose guests
when the service context disappears:

- "Can we sit by the window?"
- "We will be late."
- "Please prepare a candle for dessert."
- "I do not eat spicy food."
- "Cancel reservation #12."

A simple chatbot can answer a FAQ. Astor Butler keeps the interaction governed:
state, consent, booking, preference, staff handoff, media delivery, event trail
and human confirmation remain visible and auditable.

## Killer Features

1. **FSM as business authority**
   Every guest interaction is routed through explicit scenarios and states.

2. **AI outside business authority**
   LLMs may classify, summarize or draft text, but they do not confirm bookings,
   payments, bids or staff actions.

3. **Hospitality memory without hidden profiling**
   Preference Map stores only explicit guest-provided preferences after consent.

4. **Draft confirmation boundary**
   Merch, tips, donations and auction bids are drafts until the guest explicitly
   confirms them.

5. **Hostess context pack**
   Booking cards include seating preference, Telegram identifiers, the original
   request and recent guest messages.

6. **Staff/admin/system projections**
   Operational chats receive human-readable cards without becoming guest FSM
   inputs.

7. **Media fidelity**
   Menus, photos, videos and documents are served through a managed media
   catalog and object storage.

8. **Commercially readable documentation**
   The repository contains both engineering contracts and restaurant-facing
   brand/commercial materials.

## Architecture

```text

Transport adapters
        |
Message Gateway
        |
Scenario Router

Domain Services

```

Core invariant:

```text
business authority = FSM + domain services
AI adapter          = interpretation and drafting only
```

## App Store / Google Play Readiness Frame

Astor Butler is currently a backend and Telegram-first MVP, not a published
mobile app. The repository is structured so a future mobile or web shell can
meet store review expectations:

- explicit privacy and consent boundary;
- policy page in [docs/policy.html](docs/policy.html);
- no hidden profiling;
- controlled user-generated input handling;
- no autonomous financial commitment by AI;
- human confirmation for bookings, service actions and disputed flows;
- documented data storage and deletion semantics;
- service role separation for guest, staff, admin and system channels.

Future mobile submission work should add:

- production privacy policy URL;
- terms of service;
- support URL and contact;
- account/data deletion workflow;
- screenshots and store copy;
- age/content rating review;
- payment-provider compliance review.

## Local Run

Infrastructure runs through Docker Compose. The Spring Boot application can be
started from IDEA or Maven.

```bash
scripts/start_local_infra.sh
scripts/run_local_app.sh
```

Important local URLs:

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`
- OpenAPI JSON: `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`
- API Gateway health: `http://localhost:8080/gateway/health`
- Backend health: `http://localhost:8080/actuator/health`
- Redpanda Console: `http://localhost:8081`
- Grafana: `http://localhost:3000`
- Neo4j Browser: `http://localhost:7474`

The `.env` file is local-only and must never be committed.

## Testing

```bash
mvn test
```

Smoke/load helpers:

```bash
scripts/run_k6_smoke.sh
scripts/run_k6_read_load.sh
```

## Commercial Materials

Restaurant-facing documents are kept separate from technical contracts:

- [Brand guide, RU](docs/commercial/BRAND_GUIDE_RU.md)
- [Commercial offer, RU](docs/commercial/COMMERCIAL_OFFER_RU.md)
- [AERIS service agreement draft, RU](docs/commercial/AERIS_SERVICE_AGREEMENT_DRAFT_RU.md)
- [One-day video shooting brief, RU](docs/commercial/VIDEO_SHOOTING_DAY_TZ_RU.md)
- [Benchmark comparison, RU](docs/commercial/BENCHMARK_COMPARISON_RU.md)
- [VCG / DNS / hosting notes, RU](docs/commercial/INFRA_DNS_NOTES_RU.md)
- [Technical note in LaTeX](docs/research/ASTOR_BUTLER_TECHNICAL_NOTE.tex)

The commercial first step is intentionally narrow:

```text
RU segment: 10 restaurants + 1 hotel
```

City, stadium and large hospitality packages are a later story.

## Benchmark Positioning

Astor Butler should not be compared to a button-based bot only by price.

| Capability | Simple Telegram bot | Astor Butler | Enterprise AI platform |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FAQ answers | yes | yes | yes |
| FSM authority | weak | strong | variable |
| Consent evidence | weak | built in | strong |
| Staff context | weak | built in | configurable |
| AI guardrails | weak | FSM/domain | vendor-specific |
| Booking context | shallow | hostess card | integration-dependent |
| Operational event trail | weak | PostgreSQL/Kafka | strong |
| Cost | low | medium | high |

The deeper comparison is in
[BENCHMARK_COMPARISON_RU.md](docs/commercial/BENCHMARK_COMPARISON_RU.md).

## Git Hygiene

Do not commit:

- `.env`
- `target/`
- `build/`
- local `.idea/*`
- `.codex*`
- local media originals from Desktop, Downloads or cloud drives

Before pushing, inspect the diff for secrets, build artifacts and unrelated
local files.
